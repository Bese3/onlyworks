Algorithm for inserting in the 2d array
  >>> Take input from the user Row , Column  , Data
  >>> Compute if the input row and column are  in the array size
  >>> Starting from the end of the array we are going to shift the array by 1 until the we reach array[row - 1][column - 1]
  >>> Then we finally put the data into the specified indecies of the array

Algorithm for traversing in the 2d array 
  >>> Create a nested loop one for row and one for column 
  >>> For each loop take a user input and store it in the array

Algorithm for searching in the 2d array(linear search)
  >>> Again we use the alogorithm for traversing and we create nested loop
  >>> Instead we use it for search in if conditions
Alogrithm for deleting in the 2d array
  >>> Taking input from user Row , Column
  >>> Delete the value specified in the array[row - 1][column - 1]
  >>> Create a loop starting from array[row][column] and shifting the values to the left by 1
